# EM43 - Emergent Model with 4 States

## Overview
EM43 is an implementation of an [emergent model (EM)](https://new.researchhub.com/fund/4130/emergent-models-a-general-modeling-framework-as-an-alternative-to-neural-networks) featuring 4 states and a neighborhood of 3 cells. This project provides both training and inference capabilities for EM models with the following characteristics:

- **Architecture**: 1-D EM
- **States**: 4 distinct states (0-3)
- **Neighborhood**: Radius-1 neighborhood (3 cells)
- **Boundary Conditions**: Open boundary conditions with 2-cell separator "BB"
- **Optimization**: Numba-accelerated parallel processing for efficient computation
- **Class-based Implementation**: All functionality encapsulated in the `EM43` class

## Project Structure
The project is now organized with a clear separation of concerns:
1. `em43_python/`: Contains the Python implementation
   - `em43_class.py`: Main EM43 class implementation
   - `config.yaml`: Configuration file for all parameters
   - `em43_demo.py`: Demo training and evaluation script
   - `em43_ga.py`: Genetic Algorithm implementation
   - `em43_utilis.py`: Utility functions
2. `em43.html`: Web-based visualization interface

## Important note
This is a **minimal working implementation** of the EM framework. Some advanced features described in the original paper such as **meta-learning**, **inductive biases**, and **state retention**â€”are **not yet implemented**.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher 

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url](https://github.com/BrightStarLabs/EM43.git)
cd EM43
```
2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv --prompt em43
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The project requires the following Python packages:
- numpy: For numerical computations
- numba: For just-in-time compilation and parallel processing
- tqdm: For progress bars during training
- matplotlib: For visualization of results
- pyyaml: For configuration management

## Usage

### Training
To train the model:
```bash
python em43_python/em43_demo.py
```

The training process can be configured through the `em43_python/config.yaml` file, which includes parameters for:
- Population size and generations
- Mutation rates
- Tournament selection parameters
- Elite fraction
- Regularization parameters
- Simulation parameters (window size, max steps, etc.)
- Checkpoint configuration

Or use command line arguments:
```bash
python em43_python/em43_demo.py --help
```

### Inference and Evaluation
To run inference and evaluate the trained model:
```bash
python em43_python/em43_demo.py
```

The script will:
1. Train the model for the specified number of generations
2. Save the best genome to `best_genome.pkl`
3. Load and evaluate the best genome
4. Generate visualizations:
   - `prediction_plot.png`: Expected vs Predicted outputs
   - `program_colors.png`: Program colormap visualization

### Python API
The model can be used programmatically through the `EM43` class:
```python
from em43_python.em43_class import EM43

# Create and load from checkpoint
em43 = EM43()
em43.load_genome()  # Loads from best_genome.pkl by default

# Run evaluation with optional plotting
outputs = em43.evaluate(plot=True)
```

The `evaluate()` method returns the model's outputs and can optionally display:
- Interactive plots of expected vs predicted outputs
- Program colormap visualization
- Detailed evaluation metrics including:
  - Stored fitness
  - Average error
  - Success rate (|err|<0.1)
  - Accuracy (exact matches)


## Features
- Parallel processing using Numba's `prange` for significant speed improvements
- Random-Immigrant Strategy for maintaining genetic diversity
- Detailed telemetry tracking including average Hamming distance
- Configurable parameters through YAML configuration
- Command-line interface with argument parsing
- Class-based API for programmatic use
- Checkpoint saving for training resumption

## Configuration
The main configuration file is `em43_python/config.yaml`, which contains all hyperparameters organized into sections:
- Population parameters
- Mutation rates
- Regularization
- Simulation parameters
- Checkpoint settings
- Input/output configuration
