# EM43 - Emergent Model with 4 States

## Overview
EM43 is an implementation of an [emergent model (EM)](https://new.researchhub.com/fund/4130/emergent-models-a-general-modeling-framework-as-an-alternative-to-neural-networks) featuring 4 states and a neighborhood of 3 cells. This project provides both training and inference capabilities for EM models with the following characteristics:

- **Architecture**: 1-D EM
- **States**: 4 distinct states (0-3)
- **Neighborhood**: Radius-1 neighborhood (3 cells)
- **Boundary Conditions**: Open boundary conditions with 2-cell separator "BB"
- **Optimization**: Numba-accelerated parallel processing for efficient computation

The project includes three main components:
1. `em43_numba.py`: Core simulation engine with Numba-accelerated parallel processing
2. `em43_numba_ga.py`: Genetic Algorithm implementation for training the model
3. `eval_best_model.py`: Evaluates best model after training.
4. `em43.html`: minimal HTML interface for evaluation purposes.

## Important note

## Limitations and Notes

This is a **minimal working implementation** of the EM framework. Some advanced features described in the original paper such as **meta-learning**, **inductive biases**, and **state retention**â€”are **not yet implemented**.

During training, programs operate on a **fixed-length tape** (`width` parameter), and the total number of computational steps is bounded (`max_steps` parameter). This constraint ensures efficient evaluation and keeps the optimization fast and parallelizable.

In contrast, the **inference interface (HTML visualization)** supports a **dynamically extending tape**, allowing for longer and more complex computations during testing or demonstration. This separation allows the model to learn a general algorithm within a bounded window and then **generalize** to arbitrary input lengths during inference.

The html interface needs the rules and the program to be manually transferred into the js code.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher 

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url](https://github.com/BrightStarLabs/EM43.git)
cd EM43
```
2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv --prompt em43
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The project requires the following Python packages:
- numpy: For numerical computations
- numba: For just-in-time compilation and parallel processing
- tqdm: For progress bars during training
- matplotlib: For visualization of results

## Usage

### Training
To train the model using the Genetic Algorithm:
```bash
python em43_numba_ga.py
```

The training process will:
- Initialize a population of candidate solutions
- Evaluate fitness using parallel processing
- Evolve the population using genetic operators
- Track progress with detailed telemetry
- Save checkpoints periodically

### Inference
To run inference on trained models:
```bash
python em43_numba.py
```

The inference engine provides fast evaluation of trained models on input data.

## Features
- Parallel processing using Numba's `prange` for significant speed improvements
- Random-Immigrant Strategy for maintaining genetic diversity
- Detailed telemetry tracking including average Hamming distance
- Configurable parameters for population size, generations, and mutation rates
- Checkpoint saving for training resumption

## Configuration
Key hyperparameters can be configured in `em43_numba_ga.py`:
- `POP_SIZE`: Population size (default: 20000)
- `N_GENERATIONS`: Number of generations (default: 300)
- `WINDOW`: Tape length (default: 200)
- `MAX_STEPS`: Maximum simulation steps (default: 800)
